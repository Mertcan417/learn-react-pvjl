/*Challenge 1 of 4: Fix a component that’s not updating 
This Clock component receives two props: color and time. When you select a different color in the select box, the Clock component receives a different color prop from its parent component. However, for some reason, the displayed color doesn’t update. Why? Fix the problem. */

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Clock({ color, time }) {
  return (
    <h1 style={{ color: color }}>
      {time}
    </h1>
  );
}
